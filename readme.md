# Program is using the A* algorithm that searches the closest way from the start node to end node.

# You can select the Start and End Node with using 'left mouse button' in the beginning of the program.

# After selecting the Start and the End Node, you can make barriers (again with using 'left mouse button')

# When you want to start the search, you can just press the 'Space' button and the code will do the rest.

# After the search done you can make a new scene with the 'c' button if you want.
